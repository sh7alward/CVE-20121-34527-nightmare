# CVE-20121-34527-nightmare
 The LPE technique does not need to work with remote RPC or SMB, as it is only working with the functions of Print Spooler. * This script embeds a Base64-encoded GZIPped payload for a custom DLL, that is patched according to your arguments, to easily add a new user to the local administrators group. * This script embeds methods from PowerSploit/[PowerUp](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1) to reflectively access the Win32 APIs. * This method does not loop through all printer drivers to find the appropriate DLL path -- it simply grabs the first driver and determines the appropriate path.
